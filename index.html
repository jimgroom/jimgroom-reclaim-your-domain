<p>The work I've been part of at UMW with <a href="http://umw.domains">Domain of
One's Own</a> encouraging faculty and students to get their own domain
and web hosting has a pretty long history that pre-dates my time at
Mary Washington. More than ten years ago now, my friend <a
href="http://castironcoding.com">Zach Davis</a> turned me on to the
world of commodity web hosting. He spun up a server and encouraged
me---along with a bunch of his friends around the country---to get a domain.
What's more, he helped us point those domains to his server and gave a
bunch of us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel">cPanel
accounts</a> so we could actually use it. He created a hosting
co-operative, similar to what <a href="http://timowens.io">Tim Owens</a>
did with <a href="http://hippiehosting.org/">Hippie Hosting</a> two
years ago, and what's now doing together with <a
href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a>. I had no idea how
important that offer of a domain and web hosting would be to my career
more than a decade later.</p>

<p>Web hosting has been the platform that has helped me to understand how 
the web works. So much of the work I'm part of now is premised on the idea 
that the best way to learn about the web is to actually build your own 
little piece of it. I approach this from my own experience. The technical stuff has
never been intuitive for me, I've spent a lot of time trying to grok how
domains, servers, code, databases, etc. work together to make the web.
I'm still struggling with that, and the work with WordPress and other
open source applications on a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP server
stack</a> has proven invaluable for wrapping my head around this stuff.</p>

<p>So, why the nostalgic look back in time? Because ten years later I find myself
part of a broader effort to help educate people about the web. And that starts with 
reclaiming your piece of the web. I've benefitted immensely from what I learned about 
web hosting and domains, and I see the role of Reclaim Your Domain as similar to what
Zach did for many of us back in the early oughts. Provide as many people as possible
with a hands-on platform for understanding of how the web works.</p>

<p>How? Well, by using this space to share my own process of taking stock of my work
on the web in an attempt to organize, archive, and explain all the while. I'll be using
<a href="http://jimgroom.reclaimyourdomain.org/blog">the blog here</a>, as well as my 
personal blog <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com">bavatuesdays</a> to narrate my own
process of reclaiming my domain.</p>
