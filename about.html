<p>I am the director of the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies and adjunct professor at the <a title="Univ of Mary Washington" href="http://umw.edu">University of Mary Washington</a> in Fredericksburg, Virginia. I have been working for over fifteen years in education with a consistent focus on the development of teaching and learning in higher education. In addition to my extensive <a href="http://jimgroom.net/home/teaching">experience teaching</a> at the college level, for the past nine years I have worked primarily in the field of instructional technology (<a href="http://jimgroom.net/home/experience">see work experience</a>).</p>

<p>My experience as an instructor coupled with my extensive collaborations with faculty and students with a specific focus on curricula, pedagogical and technologically enhanced projects has informed much of the innovative work I have been a part of in the field of instructional technology over the last decade.</p>

<p>I have been part of a number of exciting projects at the University of Mary Washington. In 2006 I started the web-based educational publishing platform <a href="http://blogs.elsweb.org">ELS Blogs</a> for the English Linguistics and Speech department at UMW. This pilot project led to the development of <a href="http://umwblogs.org">UMW Blogs</a> in 2007 which has since become an enterprise level academic publishing platform. In 2008 the madness that was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edupunk">EDUPUNK</a> was attributed to <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/tag/edupunk">a series of posts</a> I wrote on my personal blog.</p>

<p>In 2010 I re-imagined the Computer Science 106 course on Digital Storytelling at UMW as an open, online community referred to as <a href="http://ds106.us">ds106</a>---an experiment in teaching and learning on the web that is still going strong and has been celebrated internationally as a compelling community-based approach to online learning. Additionally, I am currently part of an initiative at the University of Mary Washington called <a href="http://umwdomains.com">A Domain of One’s Own</a> that, starting in Fall 2013, will give all incoming Freshman their own domain and web hosting account. You can see more of my projects <a href="http://jimgroom.net/projects">here</a>.</p>

<p>For a clearer picture of my approach to teaching and learning technologies in higher education take a look at a selection of <a href="http://jimgroom.net/home/presentations">presentations and interviews</a> I have given over the past nine years.</p>

<p>Finally, I write regularly about my work as an instructional technologist--in addition to several other interests of mine such as film, literature, and media of all kinds--on my home away from home: <a title="bavatuesdays" href="http://bavatuesdays.com">bavatuesdays</a>.</p>
